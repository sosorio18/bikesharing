## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a proposal that will show stakeholders to invest in a bike sharing program. According to statistics from a current ride sharing program, investors will see if it is worth investing in another city. Visualizations were created to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
